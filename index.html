            <h3>Github username: <a href="https://github.com/alexa-grau">@alexa-grau</a></h3>

            <p>My name is Alexa Grau and I am a junior at Santa Clara University.
                I study web design and engineering in addition to being a member of
                the school's water polo team. Even when I'm not playing water polo,
                you can find me at the pool relaxing.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, I like baking (and eating) sweets. I also enjoy watching
                The Office, and am very sad to hear it will be leaving Netflix.
            </p>

            <p>I'm extremely excited for my time in Lisbon, not only to explore the city
                but also to meet amazing people and learn invaluable skills. I'm sure all the
                pasteis de nata I eat in the next couple weeks will greatly benefit my coding
                abilities too ;)
