            <h3>Github username: @alexa-grau</h3>

            <p>My name is Alexa Grau and I am a junior at Santa Clara University.
                I study web design and engineering in addition to being a member of
                the school's water polo team. Even when I'm not playing water polo,
                you can find me at the pool relaxing.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, I like baking (and eating) sweets. I also enjoy watching
                The Office, and am very sad to hear it will be leaving Netflix.
            </p>
